This is where I will be putting my attempts at the different ways I can call the CLI of asap-docking cross-docking and really praying it works. All are variations on how I am trying to prep and dock the ligands with openeye.  

Currently, the only case of it working was when I use the most basic calling methods of inputting the pdb file and smi file to be prepped within the call. See folder orig_dock for specifics.

Currently facing issues of it recognizing the prepped structure as valid. See folder dock_cache_fail for specifics.

All the notebooks are variations of docking trials in no particular order or manner.
