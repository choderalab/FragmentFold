This is where I will be putting my attempts at the different ways I can call the CLI of asap-docking cross-docking and really praying it works. 

Currently, the only case of it working was when I use the most basic calling methods of inputting the pdb file and smi file to be prepped within the call. See folder test_dock for specifics.
Would really like to be able to use the cache directory of pre-prepped protein and ligands. Currently facing issues of it recognizing the prepped structure as valid. See folder dock_cache_fail for specifics.
