This folder contains the files I used to run colabfold and the output of the folded structures. The folder also contains notebook pre-process.ipynb used to put the ligands from the original crystal screen into the folded structure in the exact same conformation the ligands appeared in the crystal screen, put into folder called combined. 
run_colabfold.sh has script for generating folded structures for the full ns2b3 matched refseq database found sequences from arborviruses_full.csv. 
colabfold_ns3_job.sh has script for generating folded structures for the only ns3 matched refseq database found sequences from ns3_truncated_match.csv. ns3_truncated_match.csv generated after putting ns3 refseq database found sequences through multiple sequence alignment and truncation so it would match more from msa_for_dock_and_match.ipynb. The multiple sequence alignment is also used for scoring functions later on.
