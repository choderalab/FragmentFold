This directory contain the jupyter notebook that contains the ways I have tried to score the re-docked ligands. compare_different_dock.ipyn has multiple different ways that I tried to score the preservation of ligand position and interactions with target protein that does not require any sequence alignment and matching knowledge.fingerprint_matrix_compare.ipynb takes into consideration whether the residues that the ligand is interacting with is at the same spot determined by multiple sequence alignment. 
The scores that I am able to test between are generated with these notebooks.
